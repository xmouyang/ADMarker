First Stage: Centralized model pre-training

Second Stage: Unsupervised multi-modal federated learning
* Client: 
	* Local unsupervised multimodal training with contrastive fusion learning
	* Send model weights to the server.
* Server: 
	* Aggregate model weights of different modalities with Fedavg;
	* Send the aggregated model weights to each client.
	
Third Stage: Supervised multi-modal federated learning
* Client: 
	* Local fusion: train the classifier layers with labeled data;
	* Send model weights to the server.
* Server: 
	* Send the aggregated model weights to each client.
