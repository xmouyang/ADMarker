# ADMarker-Example-Datasets

This repo includes real-world multi-modal datasets collected for Alzheimer’s Disease Monitoring, which are used in the MobiCom 2024 paper: "ADMarker: A Multi-Modal Federated Learning System for Monitoring Digital Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease".



# Download

  The four pre-processed datasets can be downloaded in the [dropbox folder](https://mycuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/1155136315_link_cuhk_edu_hk/EvkjzyZRYBBIuaBD-tR8-7QBzaJ1xIfa1eQGUIveGTwPPw?e=wdET4Y). Please refer to the following discriptions of collecting and pre-processing for each dataset. 
  
  
### Dataset Discriptions: 

* Task: Detect 16 behavior biomarkers in natural home environments, including cleaning the living area, taking medication, using mobile phones, writing, sitting, standing, moving in/out of chair/bed, walking, sleeping, eating, and drinking.
* Sensor Modalities: Depth Camera, mmWave Radar and Microphone.
* Number of Sensor Nodes: 16 nodes deployed in 16 elderly subjects' homes.
* Size of the dataset: About 8GB.
